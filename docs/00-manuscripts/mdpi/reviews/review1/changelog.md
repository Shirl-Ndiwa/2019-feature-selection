Changelog

- Corrected an error in the code which lead NRI and VI indices use the first four corrupted bands of the hyperspectral data. This change lead to small, non-significant changes in the performance of the benchmark settings involving these feature sets.
- Moved l.55 - l.62 to the end of the introduction as suggested by Reviewer2
- Add more introductory content for the "tree defoliation" topic as suggested by Reviewer2
- Increased number of digits from two to three in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 as suggested by Reviewer3.
- Figure 3: Removed erroneous statement about SE values and increased digits from two to three to highlight small differences in the results as suggested by Reviewer1 and Reviewer3.
- Rephrased the introduction and reasoning on why filters methods were chosen over wrapper methods as suggested by Reviewer3
- Emphasize feature set differences earlier in the manuscript to underline the benchmarking idea of the study as suggested by Reviewer3
- Explain in more detail why a pairwise-correlation variable selection was applied as a preprocessing step as suggested by Reviewer3
- Add reference https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04295 underlining the mentioned current research with respect to the development of robust methods for unbiased estimation of feature importance for highly correlated variables.
