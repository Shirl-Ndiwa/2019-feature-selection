> This study aimed to investigate if feature selection could affect tree defoliation estimation using hyperspectral data. The authors mainly focused on comparing the performance of different machine learners, feature sets and feature selection algorithms, which makes it just a comparison study. Also, due to the very small study sites, I think the results are not transferable in other contexts. My major concern is that the study did not well explain the relationship between the technical results and the response variable. The results and discussion were presented mainly focusing on the algorithms, which is not consistent with the title.

Thank you for the feedback.
A sample of 1808 observations might appear small compared to other machine learning applications these days, however, sampling such an amount of observations in the field requires intense work over several days/weeks.
We also would have liked to work with even more observations; being able to even better showcase intra-plot differences and possible fitting better models.
Unfortunately in environmental work there are always practical limits, especially with respect to data collection.
We have discussed the limitations of the data used in section 4.5 and also mentioned the poor performance of the models.
Nevertheless, we still believe that the content of this study adds value for the community, event though more from a methodological than a practicable point of view.

FIXME: Yes, we have not much linkage between defoliation and the results. Think about a solution.

> Tree defoliation is an important indicator of tree health and is the response variable of this study. However, I only saw two sentences mentioning it.

Thanks for the feedback.
Defoliation is an important part of this manuscript and we've reviewed our introduction of the terminology:
"Defoliation" was already six times mentioned in the introduction section.
Nevertheless, we have added more context to why defoliation can be a promising proxy for tree health in l.33 - l43.
We hope that overall the provided information will now suffice to introduce the topic of defoliation to the reader.
Please note that besides analyzing tree defoliation there is a strong focus on methodology in this work, which is why defoliation has been introduced in a brief way compared to tree defoliation studies found in forest ecology journals.

> Lines 55-57, there are many studies using ML and hyperspectral data to assess defoliation. It seems that the authors didn't do any literature review on this topic?

Thanks for sharing your expertise with us.
We conducted a literature research on this topic as otherwise we would not have stated this fact.
However, it is always possible to miss certain publications along the way.
If you are aware of specific studies which we have missed, we would be grateful for direct links to such so we can review these and possible include them in the manuscript.

> Lines 58-62 should be moved to the end of the introduction where you briefly introduce the overall methodology of your study.

Thanks for the suggestion.
We moved the mentioned paragraph to the end of the introduction.
