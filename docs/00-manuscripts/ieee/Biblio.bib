The research addresses the need for improved monitoring of areas included in the European Natura 2000 network. Thirty-eight vegetation indices (VI) are assessed for sensitivity to topographic variations. A separability analysis is performed for the resulting set of ten VI whereby two VI (PSSRc2, SR 800/550) are found most suitable for threshold-based OBIA classification. With a correlation analysis (SRCC) between VI and the training samples we identify Datt4 as suitable to represent the magnitude of forest disturbance. The provided information layers illustrate two combined phenomena that were derived by (1) an OBIA delineation and (2) continuous representation of the magnitude of forest disturbance. The satisfactory accuracy assessment results confirm that the approach is useful for operational tasks in the long-term monitoring of Norway spruce dominated forests in mountainous areas, with regard to forest disturbance.},

  abstract = {When fitting black box supervised learning models (e.g., complex trees, neural networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbors, local kernel-weighted methods, etc.), visualizing the main effects of the individual predictor variables and their low-order interaction effects is often important, and partial dependence (PD) plots are the most popular approach for accomplishing this. However, PD plots involve a serious pitfall if the predictor variables are far from independent, which is quite common with large observational data sets. Namely, PD plots require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the training data, which can render the PD plots unreliable. Although marginal plots (M plots) do not require such extrapolation, they produce substantially biased and misleading results when the predictors are dependent, analogous to the omitted variable bias in regression. We present a new visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects (ALE) plots, which inherits the desirable characteristics of PD and M plots, without inheriting their preceding shortcomings. Like M plots, ALE plots do not require extrapolation; and like PD plots, they are not biased by the omitted variable phenomenon. Moreover, ALE plots are far less computationally expensive than PD plots.},

  abstract = {Technological developments and open data policies have made large, global environmental datasets accessible to everyone. For analyzing such datasets, including spatiotemporal correlations using traditional models based on Gaussian processes does not scale with data volume and requires strong assumptions about stationarity, separability, and distance measures of covariance functions that are often unrealistic for global data. Only very few modeling approaches suitably model spatiotemporal correlations while addressing both computational scalability as well as flexible covariance models. In this paper, we provide an extension to the multi-resolution approximation (MRA) approach for spatiotemporal modeling of global datasets. MRA has been shown to be computationally scalable in distributed computing environments and allows for integrating arbitrary user-defined covariance functions. Our extension adds a spatiotemporal partitioning, and fitting of complex covariance models including nonstationarity with kernel convolutions and spherical distances. We evaluate the effect of the MRA parameters on estimation and spatiotemporal prediction using simulated data, where computation times reduced around two orders of magnitude with an increase of the root-mean-square prediction error of around five percent. This allows for trading off computation times against prediction errors, and we derive a practical strategy for selecting the MRA parameters. We demonstrate how the approach can be practically used for analyzing daily sea surface temperature data on global scale and compare models with different complexities in the covariance function.},

This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

  abstract = {Both feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are key tasks in machine learning. Hyperparameter tuning is often useful to increase model performance, while feature selection is undertaken to attain sparse models. Sparsity may yield better model interpretability and lower cost of data acquisition, data handling and model inference. While sparsity may have a beneficial or detrimental effect on predictive performance, a small drop in performance may be acceptable in return for a substantial gain in sparseness. We therefore treat feature selection as a multi-objective optimization task. We perform hyperparameter tuning and feature selection simultaneously because the choice of features of a model may influence what hyperparameters perform well. We present, benchmark, and compare two different approaches for multi-objective joint hyperparameter optimization and feature selection: The first uses multi-objective model-based optimization. The second is an evolutionary NSGA-II-based wrapper approach to feature selection which incorporates specialized sampling, mutation and recombination operators. Both methods make use of parameterized filter ensembles. While model-based optimization needs fewer objective evaluations to achieve good performance, it incurs computational overhead compared to the NSGA-II, so the preferred choice depends on the cost of evaluating a model on given data.},

For genetic data, it is not only important to find a model with high predictive accuracy, but it is also important that this model uses only few features and that the selection of these features is stable. This is because, in bioinformatics, the models are used not only for prediction but also for drawing biological conclusions which makes the interpretability and reliability of the model crucial. We suggest using three target criteria when fitting a predictive model to a high-dimensional data set: the classification accuracy, the stability of the feature selection, and the number of chosen features. As it is unclear which measure is best for evaluating the stability, we first compare a variety of stability measures. We conclude that the Pearson correlation has the best theoretical and empirical properties. Also, we find that for the stability assessment behaviour it is most important that a measure contains a correction for chance or large numbers of chosen features. Then, we analyse Pareto fronts and conclude that it is possible to find models with a stable selection of few features without losing much predictive accuracy.},

For feature selection, filter methods play an important role, since they can be combined with any machine learning model and can heavily reduce run time of machine learning algorithms. The aim of the analyses is to review how different filter methods work, to compare their performance with respect to both run time and predictive accuracy, and to provide guidance for applications. Based on 16~high-dimensional classification data sets, 22~filter methods are analyzed with respect to run time and accuracy when combined with a classification method. It is concluded that there is no group of filter methods that always outperforms all other methods, but recommendations on filter methods that perform well on many of the data sets are made. Also, groups of filters that are similar with respect to the order in which they rank the features are found. For the analyses, the R machine learning package mlr is used. It provides a uniform programming API and therefore is a convenient tool to conduct feature selection using filter methods.},

  abstract = {A consistent and hierarchical classification of vegetation, such as the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (NVC) system, supports comprehensive conservation and management of natural ecosystems. At a detailed level, the NVC alliance is defined by diagnostic species and composition. Maps at this level of classification are often produced at local to regional scales (areas {$<$}25,000 km2) with costly manual to semi-automated interpretation of high resolution imagery. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of machine learning for automated, per-pixel (30 m) mapping of forest alliances with multi-seasonal hyperspectral imagery from a future satellite mission (HyspIRI), as simulated from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Classic (AVIRIS-C) data. The study area was the San Francisco (S.F.) Bay Area, California, where we mapped forest alliances at regional and county scales. We implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in a two-stage approach, first mapping regional land cover followed by forest alliances in closed-canopy tree pixels. Predictor variables were reflectance bands and hyperspectral metrics based on indices, derivatives and absorption-fitting techniques applied to reflectance spectra, with data grouped into summer and three-season (spring, summer, fall) sets. For forest alliances, hyperspectral metrics improved overall accuracy of classifications by 2.9 to 6.4\% relative to classifications based on the original reflectance bands. Multi-seasonal data improved overall accuracy by 1.3 to 6.2\% relative to summer-only data. Using multi-seasonal metrics, the S.F. Bay Area regional classification with 21 alliances had an overall accuracy of 65.7\% (Kappa 0.63), while the Sonoma County classification with 16 alliances had an accuracy of 75.9\% (Kappa 0.72). Most forest alliances had internal variation in lifeform, species and structural properties that increased within-class spectral-temporal variation and complicated discrimination. Despite this challenge, classification accuracies were similar to regional NVC alliance reference data.

  abstract = {The area of North American forests affected by gypsy moth defoliation continues to expand despite efforts to slow the spread. With the increased area of infestation, ecological, environmental and economic concerns about gypsy moth disturbance remain significant, necessitating coordinated, repeatable and comprehensive monitoring of the areas affected. In this study, our primary objective was to estimate the magnitude of defoliation using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for a gypsy moth outbreak that occurred in the US central Appalachian Mountains in 2000 and 2001. We focused on determining the appropriate spectral MODIS indices and temporal compositing method to best monitor the effects of gypsy moth defoliation. We tested MODIS-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and two versions of the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDIIb6 and NDIIb7, using the channels centered on 1640~nm and 2130~nm respectively) for their capacity to map defoliation as estimated by ground observations. In addition, we evaluated three temporal resolutions: daily, 8-day and 16-day data. We validated the results through quantitative comparison to Landsat based defoliation estimates and traditional sketch maps. Our MODIS based defoliation estimates based on NDIIb6 and NDIIb7 closely matched Landsat defoliation estimates derived from field data as well as sketch maps. We conclude that daily MODIS data can be used with confidence to monitor insect defoliation on an annual time scale, at least for larger patches ({$>$}0.63~km2). Eight-day and 16-day MODIS composites may be of lesser use due to the ephemeral character of disturbance by the gypsy moth.},

Choosing the most important features is an essential step for knowledge discovery in many areas of biomedical informatics. The increased popularity of feature selection methods and their frequent utilisation raise challenging new questions about the interpretability and stability of feature selection techniques. In this study, we compared the behaviour of ten state-of-the-art filter methods for feature selection in terms of their stability, similarity, and influence on prediction performance. All of the experiments were conducted on eight two-class datasets from biomedical areas. While entropy-based feature selection appears to be the most stable, the feature selection techniques yielding the highest prediction performance are minimum redundance maximum relevance method and feature selection based on Bhattacharyya distance. In general, univariate feature selection techniques perform similarly to or even better than more complex multivariate feature selection techniques with high-dimensional datasets. However, with more complex and smaller datasets multivariate methods slightly outperform univariate techniques.},

The proposed methods are examined using three accuracy measures: the ability to correctly identify relevant features, FS stability, and influence on classification. The ensembles and clustered ensembles based on a weighted Borda count show very balanced performance, achieving quality results in all investigated measures and outperforming the other methods examined.},

Knowledge on tree species is relevant for biomass estimation, habitat quality assessment, and biodiversity characterization. Hyperspectral data have been proven to have a high potential for the mapping of tree species composition. However, open questions remain concerning the robustness of existing classification approaches. Here, a number of classification approaches were compared to classify tree species from airborne hyperspectral data across three forest sites to identify a single approach which continuously delivers high classification performances over all test sites. Examined approaches included three feature selection methods [genetic algorithm (GA), support vector machines (SVM) wrapper, and sparse generalized partial least squares selection (PLS)] each combined with two nonparametric classifiers (SVM and Random Forest). Two further setups included classifications applied to the full hyperspectral dataset and to an image transformed with a minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation. Results showed that SVM wrapper and the GA slightly outperformed the PLS-based algorithm. In most cases, the best classification runs involving a feature selection algorithm outperformed those incorporating the full hyperspectral dataset. However, the best overall results were obtained when using the first 10-20 components of the MNF-transformed image. Selected bands were frequently located in the visual region close to the green peak, at the chlorophyll absorption feature and the red edge rise as well as in three parts of the short-wave infrared region close to water absorption features. These findings are relevant for improving the robustness of tree species classifications from airborne hyperspectral data incorporating feature reduction techniques.},

It is a very challenge issue to select an effective feature subset with the unavailability of class labels. To select the features maximally preserving the information of original features, a maximum joint mutual information (MJMI) criterion is defined. Since the high-order distribution involved in MJMI is hard to calculate, a maximum information and minimum redundancy (MIMR) criterion is derived as the low-order approximation of MJMI. From information theory, many classical unsupervised feature selection criteria can also be considered as the low-order approximations of MJMI. Compared with them, MIMR requires more relaxed approximation condition. Moreover, a new clonal selection algorithm (CSA) in artificial immune system is devised to optimize the selected features with the guidance of MIMR. Experimental results on several hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better feature subsets compared with classical unsupervised feature selection methods.},

The use of high spectral resolution data offers the opportunity to select the optimal wavebands for predicting plant chemical properties. In order to test the optimal band combinations for predicting nitrogen content, normalized ratio indices were calculated for all wavebands between 350 and 2200 nm for five different species. The correlation between these indices and the nitrogen content of the samples was calculated and compared between species. The results show a strong correlation between individual normalized ratio indices and the nitrogen content for different species. The spectral regions that are most effective for predicting nitrogen content are, for each individual species, different from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) spectral region. By combining the areas of maximum correlation it was possible to determine the optimal spectral regions for predicting leaf nitrogen content across species. In a cross-species situation, normalized ratio indices using the combination of reflectance at 1770 nm and at 693 nm may give the best relation to nitrogen content for individual species.},

Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such ``TreeBoost'' models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

  abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of four feature selection (FS) algorithms in an object-based image analysis framework for very-high-resolution land use-land cover classification. The selected FS algorithms, correlation-based feature selection, mean decrease in accuracy, random forest (RF) based recursive feature elimination, and variable selection using random forest, were tested on the extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, RF, and recursive partitioningclassifiers, respectively. The results demonstrate that the selection of an appropriate FS method can be crucial to the performance of a machine learning classifier in terms of accuracy but also parsimony. In this scope, we propose a new metric to perform model selection named classification optimization score (COS) that rewards model simplicity and indirectly penalizes for increased computational time and processing requirements using the number of features for a given classification model as a surrogate. Our findings suggest that applying rigorous FS along with utilizing the COS metric may significantly reduce the processing time and the storage space while at the same time producing higher classification accuracy than using the initial dataset.},

  abstract = {Microarray datasets play a crucial role in cancer detection. But the high dimension of these datasets makes the classification challenging due to the presence of many irrelevant and redundant features. Hence, feature selection becomes irreplaceable in this field because of its ability to remove the unrequired features from the system. As the task of selecting the optimal number of features is an NP-hard problem, hence, some meta-heuristic search technique helps to cope up with this problem. In this paper, we propose a 2-stage model for feature selection in microarray datasets. The ranking of the genes for the different filter methods are quite diverse and effectiveness of rankings is datasets dependent. First, we develop an ensemble of filter methods by considering the union and intersection of the top-n features of ReliefF, chi-square, and symmetrical uncertainty. This ensemble allows us to combine all the information of the three rankings together in a subset. In the next stage, we use genetic algorithm (GA) on the union and intersection to get the fine-tuned results, and union performs better than the latter. Our model has been shown to be classifier independent through the use of three classifiers\textemdash multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (K-NN). We have tested our model on five cancer datasets\textemdash colon, lung, leukemia, SRBCT, and prostate. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of our model in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clem.], Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is a native defoliating insect with an important disturbance role in the eastern boreal forests of North America. With an extensive history of outbreaks and associated impacts on forest structural changes and timber supply, the mapping of spruce budworm defoliation has been of major management importance. In this study we assessed the ability of high spatial resolution digital aerial photogrammetric (DAP) data to predict cumulative defoliation as well as basal area and merchantable volume in spruce budworm host stands in the Gordon Cosens Forest south of Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada. To do so, DAP derived structural and spectral metrics were incorporated to implement a stratified sampling design to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of field surveying. Standard forest inventory measurements including diameter and height, as well as ocular and branch level defoliation assessments were undertaken on thirty 400 m2 radius plots. A partial least squares analysis was performed to determine whether structural metrics from a DAP point cloud could be influenced by spruce budworm defoliation, as well as determine the relative effectiveness of spectral (e.g. mean NDVI) vs. structural (e.g. 90th percentile of height) metrics, or their combination, for predicting cumulative defoliation. Results indicated that spectral metrics were the most effective for predicting cumulative defoliation (R2 = 0.79), while structural metrics were the least effective (R2 = 0.49). Metrics characterizing variance of the spectral values were found to be the most important predictors. Structural metrics and linear regression were also used to estimate landscape-level volume and basal area per hectare yielding R2 = 0.80 and R2 = 0.90, respectively. Outcomes of this analysis indicate that DAP-derived spectral metrics were more capable of modeling cumulative defoliation, while structural metrics were effective for landscape-level estimations of standard forest inventory attributes. This analysis indicated that the provision of both spectral and structural metrics from a single aerial imagery survey has potential to enhance defoliation monitoring and forest attribute modeling at a landscape-level.},

  abstract = {In the era of "big data", it is becoming more of a challenge to not only build state-of-the-art predictive models, but also gain an understanding of what's really going on in the data. For example, it is often of interest to know which, if any, of the predictors in a fitted model are relatively influential on the predicted outcome. Some modern algorithms---like random forests and gradient boosted decision trees---have a natural way of quantifying the importance or relative influence of each feature. Other algorithms---like naive Bayes classifiers and support vector machines---are not capable of doing so and model-free approaches are generally used to measure each predictor's importance. In this paper, we propose a standardized, model-based approach to measuring predictor importance across the growing spectrum of supervised learning algorithms. Our proposed method is illustrated through both simulated and real data examples. The R code to reproduce all of the figures in this paper is available in the supplementary materials.},

  abstract = {In bioinformatics, the vast of multi-label type of datasets, including clinical text, gene, and protein data, need to be categorized. Specifically, due to the redundant or irrelevant features in bioinformatics data, the performance of multi-label classifiers will be limited, and therefore, selecting effective features from the feature space is necessary. However, most of the proposed methods, which aimed at dealing with multi-label feature selection problem in the past few years, only adopt a simple and direct strategy that transforms the multi-label feature selection problem into more single-label ones and ignore correlations among different labels. In this paper, a novel algorithm named ensemble embedded feature selection (EEFS) is proposed to handle multi-label bioinformatics data learning problem in a more effective and efficient way. The EEFS does not only explicitly find out the correlations among labels, but it can also adequately utilize the label correlations by multi-label classifiers and evaluation measures. Furthermore, it can reduce the accumulated errors of data itself by employing an ensemble method. The experimental results on five multi-label bioinformatics datasets show that our algorithm achieves significant superiority over the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues).

Three machine-learning (ML) methods were tested: k-nearest neighbors (kNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). Regression models predicted stands defoliation with moderate accuracy. R2 values for regression models amounted to 0.53, 0.57, 0.57 for kNN, RF and SVM, accordingly. Analogically, the following values of normalized root mean squared error were obtained: 12.2\%, 11.9\% and 11.6\%. Overall accuracies for two-class classification models were 78\%, 75\%, 78\% for kNN, RF and SVM methods.

The present study evaluated the ability of canopy reflectance spectroscopy at the range from 350 to 2500 nm to predict GY in a large panel (368 genotypes) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) through multivariate ridge regression models. Plants were treated under three water regimes in the Mediterranean conditions of central Chile: severe water stress (SWS, rain fed), mild water stress (MWS; one irrigation event around booting) and full irrigation (FI) with mean GYs of 1655, 4739, and 7967 kg{$\bullet$}ha-1, respectively. Models developed from reflectance data during anthesis and grain filling under all water regimes explained between 77\% and 91\% of the GY variability, with the highest values in SWS condition. When individual models were used to predict yield in the rest of the trials assessed, models fitted during anthesis under MWS performed best. Combined models using data from different water regimes and each phenological stage were used to predict grain yield, and the coefficients of determination (R2) increased to 89.9\% and 92.0\% for anthesis and grain filling, respectively. The model generated during anthesis in MWS was the best at predicting yields when it was applied to other conditions. Comparisons against conventional reflectance indices were made, showing lower predictive abilities. It was concluded that a Ridge Regression Model using a data set based on spectral reflectance at anthesis or grain filling represents an effective method to predict grain yield in genotypes under different water regimes.},

  abstract = {The red edge is the sharp change in leaf reflectance between 680 and 750 nm and has been measured on leaves of a variety of species by first derivative reflectance spectrophotometry. A parameter {$\lambda$}re was defined as the wavelength of maximum slope and found to be dependent on chlorophyll concentration (p{$<$}0.001), with additional effects of species, developmental stage, leaf layering and leaf water content. The maximum slope parameter was found to be independent of simulated ground area coverage. Often two {$\lambda$}re components were identified and both showed a linear relationship with the chlorophyll content of the leaves. The results have been interpreted in terms of Beer's Law and Kubelka-Munk theory. The chlorophyll concentration dependence of {$\lambda$}re seems to be explained in terms of a pure absorption effect, and it is suggested that the existence of two {$\lambda$}re components arises from the additional factor of leaf scattering properties. In comparison to broad band reflectance, the results indicate that red edge measurements will be valuable for assessment of vegetative chlorophyll status and leaf area index independently of ground cover variations, and are particularly suitable for early stress detection.},

  abstract = {Feature extraction based on ridge regression (FERR) is proposed in this article. In FERR, a feature vector is defined in each spectral band using the mean of all classes in that dimension. Then, it is modelled using a linear combination of its farthest neighbours from among other defined feature vectors. The representation coefficients obtained by solving the ridge regression model compose the projection matrix for feature extraction. FERR can extract each desired number of features while the other methods such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) have limitations in the number of extracted features. Experimental results on four popular real hyperspectral images show that the efficiency of FERR is superior to those of other supervised feature extraction methods in small sample-size situations. For example, for the Indian Pines dataset, the comparison between the highest average classification accuracies achieved by different feature extraction methods using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and 16 training samples per class shows that FERR is 7\% more accurate than nonparametric weighted feature extraction and is also 9\% better than GDA. LDA, having the singularity problem in the small sample-size situations, has 40\% less accuracy than FERR. The experiments show that generally the performance of FERR using the SVM classifier is better than when using the maximum likelihood classifier.},

  abstract = {Tropical forest condition has important implications for biodiversity, climate change and human needs. Structural features of forests can serve as useful indicators of forest condition and have the potential to be assessed with remotely sensed imagery, which can provide quantitative information on forest ecosystems at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Herein, we investigate the utility of remote sensing for assessing, predicting and mapping two important forest structural features, stem density and basal area, in tropical, littoral forests in southeastern Madagascar. We analysed the relationships of basal area and stem density measurements to the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiance measurements in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Strong relationships were identified among all of the individual bands and field based measurements of basal area (p{$<$}0.01) while there were weak and insignificant relationships among spectral response and stem density measurements. NDVI was not significantly correlated with basal area but was strongly and significantly correlated with stem density (r=-0.69, p{$<$}0.01) when using a subset of the data, which represented extreme values. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict basal area from radiance values in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 and to produce a predictive map of basal area for the entire forest landscape. The ANNs produced strong and significant relationships between predicted and actual measures of basal area using a jackknife method (r=0.79, p{$<$}0.01) and when using a larger data set (r=0.82, p{$<$}0.01). The map of predicted basal area produced by the ANN was assessed in relation to a pre-existing map of forest condition derived from a semi-quantitative field assessment. The predictive map of basal area provided finer detail on stand structural heterogeneity, captured known climatic influences on forest structure and displayed trends of basal area associated with degree of human accessibility. These findings demonstrate the utility of ANNs for integrating satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ spectral bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 with limited field survey data to assess patterns in basal area at the landscape scale.},

Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia billingiae, and Bacillus simplex reduced the growth of the fungus in vitro by 17\%\textendash 29\%, and decreased the density of the mycelial mat. In young P. radiata trees, the length of F. circinatum lesions was reduced by 22\%\textendash 25\% by the same bacterial strains. Direct application of cinnamon and/or clove essential oils to wounds in stems of two-year-old P. radiata trees also limited the damage caused by F. circinatum. Lesion length was reduced by 51\% following treatment with cinnamon oil (10\% v/v), and by 45\% following treatment with clove oil (15\% v/v) or a combination of both oils. However, the oils were toxic to younger trees. The biocontrol bacteria and essential oils show promise as prophylactic treatments to reduce the devastating effects of F. circinatum on P. radiata.},

  abstract = {Epiphyllous liverworts form a special group of bryophytes that primarily grow on leaves of understory vascular plants, occurring in constantly moist and warm evergreen forest in tropical and subtropical regions. They are very sensitive to climate change and environmental pollution. Previous studies have focused largely on microhabitat preferences of epiphyllous liverworts and demonstrated the importance of climate factors such as humidity, temperature and light. However, little is known about the relationship between distribution of epiphyllous liverworts and macro-habitat factors at broad spatial scales. Here, we predicated the distribution of epiphyllous liverworts in China based on topographic and bioclimatic variables, as well as satellite-derived vegetation indices at a 1km spatial resolution using presence-only ecological niche models. We used the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) to validate the models, and then used the Wilcoxon paired test to compare model performances. Furthermore, we applied the jackknife test to identify the important factors affecting predictions. Our results showed that the highest accuracy (i.e., AUC=0.98 and TSS=0.93) in predicting epiphyllous liverworts was achieved by the model that combined climatic and remotely sensed vegetation variables. The satellite-derived annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as well as the annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) emerged as the most important predictors of distribution patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, while climatic variables such as precipitation in the wettest quarter and temperature of the coldest quarter were of ancillary importance. The significant contributions of NDVI and NDWI in defining the distribution range and spatial patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, and the strong relationship between this species and evergreen forest implies that epiphyllous liverworts may be a useful indicator for forest degradation or integrity at broad spatial scales.},

  abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose to estimate tree defoliation from ground-level RGB photos with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Tree defoliation is usually assessed with field campaigns, where experts estimate multiple tree health indicators per sample site. Campaigns span entire countries to come up with a holistic, nationwide picture of forest health. Surveys are very laborious, expensive, time-consuming and need a large number of experts. We aim at making the monitoring process more efficient by casting tree defoliation estimation as an image interpretation problem. What makes this task challenging is the strong variance in lighting, viewpoint, scale, tree species, and defoliation types. Instead of accounting for each factor separately through explicit modeling, we learn a joint distribution directly from a large set of annotated training images following the end-to-end learning paradigm of deep learning. The proposed workflow works as follows: (i) Human experts visit individual trees in forests distributed all over Switzerland, (ii) acquire one photo per tree with an off-the-shelf, hand-held RGB camera, and (iii) assign a defoliation value. The CNN approach is (iv) trained on a subset of the images with expert defoliation assessments and (v) tested on a hold-out part to check predicted values against ground truth. We evaluate our supervised method on three data sets with different level of difficulty acquired in Swiss forests and achieve an average mean absolute error (avgMAE) of 7.6\% for the joint data set after cross-validation. Comparison to a group of human experts on one of the data sets shows that our CNN approach performs only 0.9\% points worse. We show that tree defoliation estimation from ground-level RGB images with a CNN works well and achieves performance close to human experts.},

  abstract = {Learning incorporates a broad range of complex procedures. Machine learning (ML) is a subdivision of artificial intelligence based on the biological learning process. The ML approach deals with the design of algorithms to learn from machine readable data. ML covers main domains such as data mining, difficult-to-program applications, and software applications. It is a collection of a variety of algorithms (e.g. neural networks, support vector machines, self-organizing map, decision trees, random forests, case-based reasoning, genetic programming, etc.) that can provide multivariate, nonlinear, nonparametric regression or classification. The modeling capabilities of the ML-based methods have resulted in their extensive applications in science and engineering. Herein, the role of ML as an effective approach for solving problems in geosciences and remote sensing will be highlighted. The unique features of some of the ML techniques will be outlined with a specific attention to genetic programming paradigm. Furthermore, nonparametric regression and classification illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of ML for tackling the geosciences and remote sensing problems.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic stress and disturbance of forest ecosystems (FES) has been increasing at all scales from local to global. In rapidly changing environments, in-situ terrestrial FES monitoring approaches have made tremendous progress but they are intensive and often integrate subjective indicators for forest health (FH). Remote sensing (RS) bridges the gaps of these limitations, by monitoring indicators of FH on different spatio-temporal scales, and in a cost-effective, rapid, repetitive and objective manner. In this paper, we provide an overview of the definitions of FH, discussing the drivers, processes, stress and adaptation mechanisms of forest plants, and how we can observe FH with RS. We introduce the concept of spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variations (STV) in the context of FH monitoring and discuss the prospects, limitations and constraints. Stress, disturbances and resource limitations can cause changes in FES taxonomic, structural and functional diversity; we provide examples how the ST/STV approach can be used for monitoring these FES characteristics. We show that RS based assessments of FH indicators using the ST/STV approach is a competent, affordable, repetitive and objective technique for monitoring. Even though the possibilities for observing the taxonomic diversity of animal species is limited with RS, the taxonomy of forest tree species can be recorded with RS, even though its accuracy is subject to certain constraints. RS has proved successful for monitoring the impacts from stress on structural and functional diversity. In particular, it has proven to be very suitable for recording the short-term dynamics of stress on FH, which cannot be cost-effectively recorded using in-situ methods. This paper gives an overview of the ST/STV approach, whereas the second paper of this series concentrates on discussing in-situ terrestrial monitoring, in-situ RS approaches and RS sensors and techniques for measuring ST/STV for FH.},

  abstract = {The water body information is accurately extracted from remotely sensed images with the method of normalized ratio index, and the water information is greatly enhanced through restricting the brightness of backgrounds. What's more, there is no noise formed by shadows in results. However, the spatial resolution of most images used for water extraction is usually not high enough to identify water body clearly. Fusion of remotely sensed images with different spatial resolution can solve this problem. Four data fusion methods such as Modified Brovey Transform (MBT), Multiplication Transform (MLT), Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation Transform (SFIMT) and High Pass Filter Transform (HPTF) have been applied to merge ETM+ panchromatic band with multi-spectral band data. Normalized ration method is adopted to extract water body information from both original and merged images. The effect of data fusion and extracting result are validated and evaluated by qualitative analysis and quantitative statistical calculation. SFIMT model enjoys the best maintenance of spectral quality from the multi-spectral bands. On the other hand, MLT model has the highest spatial frequency information gain. In the data fusion algorithms, SFIMT is the optimization data fusion method appropriate to the normalized ration water extracting model.},

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},

However the drivers of bush encroachment are not yet fully revealed which can partly be attributed to the problem that large-scale data of woody vegetation cover are missing. Using a multi-scale and a multi-sensor approach, this study aimed at providing the status of woody vegetation cover for the Molopo Area in South Africa. Training data for woody vegetation was derived from unsupervised classification of high-resolution aerial image tiles. To derive spatially continuous estimates of fractional woody cover for the entire Molopo Area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were applied in a machine learning based modelling approach. Therefore, a database of training samples was generated by aggregating the classified aerial image tiles to the geometry of the Sentinel data. A Random Forest algorithm with a forward feature variable selection was then trained to relate the spectral and radar information to fractional woody cover. The model was applied to make spatial predictions of fractional woody cover at 10 m resolution for the entire Molopo Area for the year 2016. Spatial cross-validation revealed a prediction error in fractional cover of 12\%. The derived model and cover data show the potential for upcoming time series analysis of Sentinel-based woody cover estimates which can serve as a basis to bring new insights into the drivers of bush encroachment.},

The Random Forest machine learning algorithm may aid carbon mapping applications using remotely-sensed data. However, Random Forest has never been compared to traditional and potentially more reliable techniques such as regionally stratified sampling and upscaling, and it has rarely been employed with spatial data. Here, we evaluated the performance of Random Forest in upscaling airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)-based carbon estimates compared to the stratification approach over a 16-million hectare focal area of the Western Amazon. We considered two runs of Random Forest, both with and without spatial contextual modeling by including\textemdash in the latter case\textemdash x, and y position directly in the model. In each case, we set aside 8 million hectares (i.e., half of the focal area) for validation; this rigorous test of Random Forest went above and beyond the internal validation normally compiled by the algorithm (i.e., called ``out-of-bag''), which proved insufficient for this spatial application. In this heterogeneous region of Northern Peru, the model with spatial context was the best preforming run of Random Forest, and explained 59\% of LiDAR-based carbon estimates within the validation area, compared to 37\% for stratification or 43\% by Random Forest without spatial context. With the 60\% improvement in explained variation, RMSE against validation LiDAR samples improved from 33 to 26 Mg C ha-1 when using Random Forest with spatial context. Our results suggest that spatial context should be considered when using Random Forest, and that doing so may result in substantially improved carbon stock modeling for purposes of climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {Defoliation by herbivorous insects is a widespread forest disturbance driver, affecting global forest health and ecosystem dynamics. Compared with time- and labor-intensive field surveys, remote sensing provides the only realistic approach to mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects over large spatial and temporal scales. However, the spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by insects at the individual tree level have not been well studied. Additionally, the predictive power of spectral and structural metrics for mapping canopy defoliation has seldom been compared. These critical knowledge gaps prevent us from consistently detecting and mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects across multiple scales. During the peak of a gypsy moth outbreak in Long Island, New York in summer 2016, we leveraged bi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS, i.e., hyperspectral imaging) and LiDAR measurements at 1 m spatial resolution to explore the spectral and structural signatures of canopy defoliation in a mixed oak-pine forest. We determined that red edge and near-infrared spectral regions within the IS data were most sensitive to crown-scale defoliation severity. LiDAR measurements including B70 (i.e., 70th bincentile height), intensity skewness, and kurtosis were effectively able to detect structural changes caused by herbivorous insects. In addition to canopy leaf loss, increased exposure of understory and non-photosynthetic materials contributed to the detected spectral and structural signatures. Comparing the ability of individual sensors to map canopy defoliation, the LiDAR-only Ordinary Least-Square (OLS) model performed better than the IS-only model (Adj. R-squared = 0.77, RMSE = 15.37\% vs. Adj. R-squared = 0.63, RMSE = 19.11\%). The IS + LiDAR model improved on performance of the individual sensors (Adj. R-squared = 0.81, RMSE = 14.46\%). Our study improves our understanding of spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by herbivorous insects and presents a novel approach for mapping insect defoliation at the individual tree level. Additionally, with the current and next generation of spaceborne sensors (e.g., WorldView-3, Landsat, Sentinel-2, HyspIRI, and GEDI), higher accuracy and frequent monitoring of insect defoliation may become more feasible across a range of spatial scales, which are critical for ecological research and management of forest resources including the economic consequences of forest insect infestations (e.g., reduced growth and increased mortality), as well as for informing and testing of carbon cycle models.},

  abstract = {Riparian forests are critically endangered many anthropogenic pressures and natural hazards. The importance of riparian zones has been acknowledged by European Directives, involving multi-scale monitoring. The use of this very-high-resolution and hyperspatial imagery in a multi-temporal approach is an emerging topic. The trend is reinforced by the recent and rapid growth of the use of the unmanned aerial system (UAS), which has prompted the development of innovative methodology. Our study proposes a methodological framework to explore how a set of multi-temporal images acquired during a vegetative period can differentiate some of the deciduous riparian forest species and their health conditions. More specifically, the developed approach intends to identify, through a process of variable selection, which variables derived from UAS imagery and which scale of image analysis are the most relevant to our objectives.The methodological framework is applied to two study sites to describe the riparian forest through two fundamental characteristics: the species composition and the health condition. These characteristics were selected not only because of their use as proxies for the riparian zone ecological integrity but also because of their use for river management.The comparison of various scales of image analysis identified the smallest object-based image analysis (OBIA) objects (ca. 1 m2) as the most relevant scale. Variables derived from spectral information (bands ratios) were identified as the most appropriate, followed by variables related to the vertical structure of the forest. Classification results show good overall accuracies for the species composition of the riparian forest (five classes, 79.5 and 84.1 \% for site 1 and site 2). The classification scenario regarding the health condition of the black alders of the site 1 performed the best (90.6 \%).The quality of the classification models developed with a UAS-based, cost-effective, and semi-automatic approach competes successfully with those developed using more expensive imagery, such as multi-spectral and hyperspectral airborne imagery. The high overall accuracy results obtained by the classification of the diseased alders open the door to applications dedicated to monitoring of the health conditions of riparian forest. Our methodological framework will allow UAS users to manage large imagery metric datasets derived from those dense time series.},

The vital aspect of this algorithm is the automatic determination of NN architectures during the FS process. Our algorithm uses a constructive approach involving correlation information in selecting features and determining NN architectures. We call this algorithm as constructive approach for FS (CAFS). The aim of using correlation information in CAFS is to encourage the search strategy for selecting less correlated (distinct) features if they enhance accuracy of NNs. Such an encouragement will reduce redundancy of information resulting in compact NN architectures. We evaluate the performance of CAFS on eight benchmark classification problems. The experimental results show the essence of CAFS in selecting features with compact NN architectures.},

  abstract = {Due to their role in certain essential forest processes, dead trees are an interesting object of study within the environmental and forest sciences. This paper describes an active learning-based approach to detecting individual standing dead trees, known as snags, from ALS point clouds and aerial color infrared imagery. We first segment individual trees within the 3D point cloud and subsequently find an approximate bounding polygon for each tree within the image. We utilize these polygons to extract features based on the pixel intensity values in the visible and infrared bands, which forms the basis for classifying the associated trees as either dead or living. We define a two-step scheme of selecting a small subset of training examples from a large initially unlabeled set of objects. In the first step, a greedy approximation of the kernelized feature matrix is conducted, yielding a smaller pool of the most representative objects. We then perform active learning on this moderate-sized pool, using expected error reduction as the basic method. We explore how the use of semi-supervised classifiers with minimum entropy regularizers can benefit the learning process. Based on validation with reference data manually labeled on images from the Bavarian Forest National Park, our method attains an overall accuracy of up to 89\% with less than 100 training examples, which corresponds to 10\% of the pre-selected data pool.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing techniques such as change detection are widely used for mapping and monitoring forest cover to detect the declining health and vigor of forests. These techniques rely on the assumption that the biophysical variation in the forest introduces a corresponding variation in its reflectance. The biophysical variations are assessed by foresters, but these assessment techniques are expensive and cannot be performed frequently to identify a specific level of change in the forest, for example, infection due to gypsy moths that results in forest defoliation. Further, the interaction of atmosphere, sensor characteristics, and phenology that are inherent in the remotely sensed images makes it difficult to separate biophysical changes from observational effects. We have addressed these limitations by developing a method to model the spectral reflectance properties of forests with varying degrees of defoliation using the Digital Image and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) tool. This paper discusses the in-canopy radiative approach and the impact of defoliation on the reflectance and radiance observed by sensors such as Landsat. The results indicate that the relative variation in forest reflectance between a non-defoliated and a 30\% defoliated deciduous forest can be as high as 10\% in the NIR spectral band. A function can be fit to predict the level of defoliation from the relative variation in radiance. The modeling and analysis techniques can be extended to assess the impact of atmospheric factors and sensor characteristics relative to the biophysical changes as well as for assessing other biophysical variables in forests.},

Numerical and categorical trees variables, in permanent plots, were used. The Agricultural Reference Index for Drought (ARID) and the distance-dependent competition index were the variables used. The overall efficiency of classification by ANNs was higher than 92\% and 93\% in the training and test, respectively. The accuracy for classification and number of surviving trees was above 99\% in the test and in training for all ANNs. The classification accuracy of the number of dead trees was low. The mortality accuracy rate (10.96\% for training and 13.76\% for the test) was higher with the ANN 4, which considers the climatic variable and the competition index. The individual tree-level model integrates dendrometric and meteorological variables, representing a new step for modeling tree survival in the Atlantic Forest biome.},

This approach integrates spectral band selection and hyperspectral image classification in an adaptive fashion, with the ultimate goal of improving the analysis and interpretation of hyperspectral imaging. The four components in the proposed adaptive feature selection, including local gradient calculation, reference cluster determination, prototype classes building using a fuzzy classifier, and relevant bands selection are presented in detail. The hyperspectral image data set from the ROSIS (Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer) were used as training and testing data. We tested the effect of the approach on different number of selected spectral bands. The classification accuracy for AFS was illustrated by the ROC curve. In addition, in order to compare the proposed method with other methods, we applied the proposed adaptive feature selection (AFS) approach and the principal component analysis (PCA) method to the GentleBoost classifier using different number of spectral bands after processing the ROSIS Pavia scene. The experimental results demonstrated that the classification accuracies obtained by the AFS method are higher than that of the PCA method. In addition, for each method, the higher the number of spectral bands, the higher the classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47\%) between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, ensemble learning has become a prolific discipline in pattern recognition, based on the assumption that the combination of the output of several models obtains better results than the output of any individual model. On the basis that the same principle can be applied to feature selection, we describe two approaches: (i) homogeneous, i.e., using the same feature selection method with different training data and distributing the dataset over several nodes; and (ii) heterogeneous, i.e., using different feature selection methods with the same training data. Both approaches are based on combining rankings of features that contain all the ordered features. The results of the base selectors are combined using different combination methods, also called aggregators, and a practical subset is selected according to several different threshold values (traditional values based on fixed percentages, and more novel automatic methods based on data complexity measures). In testing using a Support Vector Machine as a classifier, ensemble results for seven datasets demonstrate performance that is at least comparable and often better than the performance of individual feature selection methods.},

  abstract = {Declining forest health can affect crucial ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water regimes, the modulation of regional climate and conservation of biodiversity. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS) are two potentially complementary remote sensing technologies capable of characterizing and monitoring regional forest health. However, the combined use of ALS and IS data to classify the health of individual trees has not yet been assessed. In this study we propose a new approach utilizing ALS and IS combined to characterize the health of individual trees. Firstly, we applied a recently developed bottom-up individual tree delineation algorithm across a structurally complex floodplain eucalypt forest that has experienced episodes of severe dieback over the past six decades. We further calculated ALS and IS indices for delineated tree crowns and used them as predictor variables in machine learning models. We trained and evaluated an object-oriented random forest classifier against field-measured tree crown dieback and transparency ratios, as indicators of eucalypt tree health and crown density, respectively. Our results showed that dieback levels of individual trees can be classified using ALS and IS with an overall accuracy of 81\% and a kappa score of 0.66, while the classification of tree crown transparency levels had an overall accuracy of 70\% and a kappa score of 0.5. Returned pulse width, intensity and density related ALS indices were the most important predictors in the tree health classification, as they accounted for {$>$}40\% of the variance in the data. At the forest level in terms of dieback, 81.5\% of correctly delineated trees were classified as healthy, 12.3\% as declining and 6.2\% as dying or dead. Dieback occurred primarily in areas that were flooded {$<$}5\% of the time, as quantified by Landsat derived flooding frequency (1986\textendash 2011). Our results provide a novel application of ALS and IS to accurately classify the health of individual trees in a structurally complex eucalypt forest, enabling us to prioritize areas for forest health promotion and conservation of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Defoliation by insect herbivores can be a persistent disturbance affecting ecosystem functioning. We developed an approach to map canopy defoliation due to gypsy moth based on site differences in Landsat vegetation index values between non-defoliation and defoliation dates. Using field data from two study areas in the U.S. central Appalachians and five different years (2000, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2008), we fit a sigmoidal model predicting defoliation as a function of the difference in the vegetation index. We found that the normalized difference infrared index (NDII, [Band 4-Band 5]/[Band 4+Band 5]) and the moisture stress index (Band 5/Band 4) worked better than visible-near infrared indices such as NDVI for mapping defoliation. We report a global 2-term fixed-effects model using all years that was at least as good as a mixed-effects model that varied the model coefficients by year. The final model was: proportion of foliage retained=1/(1+exp(3.057-31.483{${_\ast}$}[NDIIbaseyear-NDIIdisturbanceyear]). Cross-validation by dropping each year of data and subsequently refitting the remaining data generated an RMS error estimate of 14.9\% defoliation, a mean absolute error of 10.8\% and a cross-validation R2 of 0.805. The results show that a robust, general model of percent defoliation can be developed to make continuous rather than categorical maps of defoliation across years and study sites based on field data collected using different sampling methods.},

To investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of surface moisture and vegetation structure, data from ESA\&rsquo;s Copernicus Sentinel-1/-2 and NASA\&rsquo;s Landsat-8 for the period between March 2015 and November 2017 were utilized. In combination, these radar and optical satellite systems provide promising data with high spatial and temporal resolution. Sentinel-1 C-band data was exploited to derive surface moisture based on a hyper-temporal co-polarized (vertical-vertical\&mdash;VV) radar backscatter change detection approach, describing dynamics between dry and wet seasons. Vegetation information from a TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanner)-derived canopy height model (CHM), as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, were utilized to analyze vegetation structure types and dynamics with respect to the surface moisture index (SurfMI). Our results indicate that our combined radar\&ndash;optical approach allows for a separation and retrieval of surface moisture conditions suitable for drought monitoring. Moreover, we conclude that it is crucial for the development of a drought monitoring system for savanna ecosystems to integrate land cover and vegetation information for analyzing surface moisture dynamics derived from Earth observation time series.},

Chlorophyll data and high spectral resolution spectrometer laboratory reflectance data were acquired for multiple collections of single detached sugar maple leaves variously affected by the insect over the 1988 growing season. Reflectance data indicated consistent and diagnostic differences in the red edge portion (680-750 nm) of the spectrum among the various samples and populations of leaves. These included differences in the red edge inflection point (REIP), a ratio of reflectance at 740-720 nm (RE3/RE2), and a ratio of first derivative values at 715-705 nm (D715/D705), All three red edge parameters were highly correlated with variation in total chlorophyll content. Other spectral measures, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Simple Vegetation Index Ratio (VI), also varied among populations and over the growing season, but did not correlate well with total chlorophyll content. Leaf stacking studies on light and dark backgrounds indicated REIP, RE3/RE2 and D715/D705 to be much less influenced by differences in green leaf biomass and background condition than either NDVI or VI.},

However, high resolution spectrometers are available and have not been fully exploited for the purpose of improving estimates of vegetation variables. A study directed to investigate the use of high spectral resolution spectroscopy for remote sensing estimates of APAR in vegetation canopies in the presence of nonphotosynthetic background materials such as soil and leaf litter is presented. A high spectral resolution method defined as the Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (CARI) was developed for minimizing the effects of nonphotosynthetic materials in the remote estimates of APAR. CARI utilizes three bands at 550, 670, and 700 nm with bandwidth of 10 nm. Simulated canopy reflectance of a range of LAI were generated with the SAIL model using measurements of 42 different soil types as canopy background. CARI obtained from the simulated canopy reflectance was compared with the broad band vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Simple Ratio (SR)). CARI reduced the effect of nonphotosynthetic background materials in the assessment of vegetation canopy APAR more effectively than broad band vegetation indices},

In large-scale applications, the number of samples one can collect is typically of the same order of (or even less than) the dimensionality of the problem. This so-called high-dimensional statistical regime has been the object of intense recent research in machine learning and statistics, primarily due to phenomena inherent to this regime, such as the fact that the noise one sees here often dwarfs the magnitude of the signal itself. While relevant in numerous important operations research and engineering optimization applications, this setup falls far outside the traditional scope of robust and stochastic optimization. We propose three algorithms to address this setting, combining ideas from statistics, machine learning, and robust optimization. Our algorithms are motivated by three natural optimization objectives: minimizing the number of grossly violated constraints; maximizing the number of exactly satisfied constraints; and, finally, developing algorithms whose running time scales with the intrinsic dimension of a problem, as opposed to its observed dimension\textemdash a mismatch that, as we discuss in detail, can be dire in settings where constraints are meant to describe preferences of behaviors. The key ingredients of our algorithms are dimensionality reduction techniques from machine learning, robust optimization, and concentration of measure tools from statistics.},

  abstract = {Land-cover classification using remote sensing imagery is an important part of environmental research because it provides baseline information for ecological vulnerability and risk assessment, disaster management, landscape conservation, local and regional planning, and so on. Rural-land-cover classification is challenging for both object-based image analysis methods and classifiers. The objective of this study is to improve the object-oriented classification accuracy of rural land cover by combining two models based on high spatial resolution imagery. We apply the C5.0 algorithm in R to combine support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest (RF) to create the model RS\_C5.0. The effectiveness of the model combination is assessed by comparing the classification results with the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The comparisons are done based on the classification results of both the study area and the case area. Results show that in the classification of the study area, RF performs slightly better than SVM, and XGBoost performs worse than RF but better than SVM. However, in the classification of the case area, SVM performs slightly better than RF and both SVM and RF perform better than XGBoost. Furthermore, RS\_C5.0 obtains the highest overall accuracies and kappa coefficients in the classifications of both the study area and the case area. In terms of training time, XGBoost runs the slowest in the classifications of both the study area and the case area. SVM and RF as well as the combined model (RS\_C5.0) run much faster than XGBoost classifier. To summarize, the combination of SVM and RF classifiers using C5.0 algorithm is found to be a fast and effective way to improve rural-land-cover classification.},

However, due to the low vegetation cover in these regions, satellite-based research is challenging. Numerous potentially useful remotely-sensed predictor variables have been proposed, and several statistical and machine-learning techniques are available for empirical spatial modeling, but their predictive performance is yet unknown in this context. We therefore modeled total biomass in the Eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan, a region with extremely low vegetation cover, with a large set of satellite based predictors derived from two commonly used sensors (Landsat OLI, RapidEye), and assessed their utility in this environment using several suitable modeling approaches (stepwise, lasso, partial least squares and ridge regression, random forest). The best performing model (lasso regression) resulted in a RMSE of 992kgha-1 in spatial cross-validation, indicating that biomass quantification in this arid setting is feasible but subject to large uncertainties. Furthermore, pronounced over-fitting in some commonly used models (e.g. stepwise regression, random forest) underlined the importance of adequate variable selection and shrinkage techniques in spatial modeling of high dimensional data. The applied sensors showed very similar performance and a combination of both only slightly improved results of better performing models. A permutation-based assessment of variable importance showed that some of the most frequently used vegetation indices are not suitable for dwarf shrub biomass prediction in this environment. We suggest that predictor variables based on several bands accounting for vegetation as well as background information are required in this arid setting.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial and temporal changes caused by episodic disturbances and seasonal variability is essential for understanding the dynamics of mangrove forests at the landscape scale, and for building a baseline that allows detection of the effects of future environmental change. In combination with LiDAR data, we calculated four vegetation indices from 150 Landsat TM images from 1985 to 2011 in order to detect seasonal changes and distinguish them from disturbances due to hurricanes and chilling events in a mangrove-dominated coastal landscape. We found that normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) performed best in identifying both seasonal and event-driven episodic changes. Mangrove responses to chilling and hurricane events exhibited distinct spatial patterns. Severe damage from intense chilling events was concentrated in the interior dwarf and transition mangrove forests with tree heights less than 4 m, while severe damage from intense hurricanes was limited to the mangrove forest near the coast, where tree heights were more than 4 m. It took 4\textendash 7 months for damage from intense chilling events and hurricanes to reach their full extent, and took 2\textendash 6 yr for the mangrove forest to recover from these disturbances. There was no significant trend in the vegetation changes represented by NDMI over the 27-yr period, but seasonal signals from both dwarf and fringe mangrove forests were discernible. Only severe damage from hurricanes and intense chilling events could be detected in Landsat images, while damage from weak chilling events could not be separated from the background seasonal change.},

  abstract = {Variable selection is a difficult problem that is particularly challenging in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data. Here, we introduce the CAR score, a novel and highly effective criterion for variable ranking in linear regression based on Mahalanobis-decorrelation of the explanatory variables. The CAR score provides a canonical ordering that encourages grouping of correlated predictors and down-weights antagonistic variables. It decomposes the proportion of variance explained and it is an intermediate between marginal correlation and the standardized regression coefficient. As a population quantity, any preferred inference scheme can be applied for its estimation. Using simulations, we demonstrate that variable selection by CAR scores is very effective and yields prediction errors and true and false positive rates that compare favorably with modern regression techniques such as elastic net and boosting. We illustrate our approach by analyzing data concerned with diabetes progression and with the effect of aging on gene expression in the human brain. The R package ``care'' implementing CAR score regression is available from CRAN.},
