# Iteration 1

This study analyzed defoliation of trees in northern Spain by using hyperspectral data as input for machine learning models which used hyperparameter tuning and filter-based feature selection.
The idea of this paper is interesting and the technical presentation sounds reasonable.
However, I still feel that the paper is much more suitable for JSTARS since it focuses on very specific domain and application field, whereas the methodological novelty is not significant for publication in TGRS.
Some detailed comments are as follows:

> 1. I would like to see what is the SNR level of the hyperspectral data, because usually the SNR makes it possible or not to identify the hyperspectral information.

> 2. I also would like to see the information redundancy that existed in the original bands, as well as in the very high dimensional constructed 7471 NRIs.

> 3. RF is usually effected by the randomization of the training process, did you only run one shot, or it is the average result from multiple trails?

> 4. The main novelty should be emphasized again which to me it is not significant and clear at this stage of presentation. Some conclusions are commonly known to all for hyperspectral feature extraction and classification. So which are the unique contributions or novelties from this work should be highlighted again.
